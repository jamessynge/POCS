If the file $HOME/AUTOMATED-RUN-POCS-ENABLED exists,
then $POCS/scripts/startup/start_pocs.sh will automatically
execute the run_pocs command inside $POCS/bin/pocs_shell.

To disable the automatic action, simply rename this file
to $HOME/AUTOMATED-RUN-POCS-ENABLED.disabled until you are
are ready for the automatic execution of POCS to resume.
