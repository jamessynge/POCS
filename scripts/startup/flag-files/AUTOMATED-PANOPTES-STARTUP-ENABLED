If the file $HOME/AUTOMATED-PANOPTES-STARTUP-ENABLED exists,
then $POCS/scripts/startup/tmux_launch.sh will automatically
run $POCS/scripts/startup/startu_panoptes_in_tmux.sh, which
in turn will start various programs involved in running a
PANOPTES automated observatory.

Note that this is conditional on tmux_launch.sh being executed,
which is normally handled by adding the following to the crontab
of the panoptes user:

# m h  dom mon dow   command
@reboot              /bin/bash --login $POCS/scripts/startup/tmux_launch.sh >> $PANLOG/tmux_launch.cron-reboot.log 2>&1

To disable the automatic action, simply rename this file
to $HOME/AUTOMATED-SETUP-POCS-ENABLED.disabled until you are
are ready for the automatic setup of POCS to resume.
