If the file $HOME/AUTOMATED-REBOOT-ENABLED exists, then
then $HOME/bin/reboot-if-pocs-not-logging.sh will test
whether POCS has been updating its log file. If not,
it will reboot the system.

To disable the automatic reboot, simply rename this file
to $HOME/AUTOMATED-REBOOT-ENABLED.disabled until you are
are ready for the automatic rebooting to resume.
